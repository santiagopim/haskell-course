-- Question 1 Write a function called `repeat'` that takes a value and
-- creates an infinite list with the value provided as every element
-- of the list.
--
-- >>> repeat 17
--[17,17,17,17,17,17,17,17,17...
repeat' :: a -> [a]
repeat' x = (x:repeat' x)

-- Question 2 Using the `repeat'` function and the `take` function we
-- defined in the lesson (comes with Haskell), create a function
-- called `replicate'` that takes a number `n` and a value `x` and
-- creates a list of length `n` with `x` as the value of every
-- element. (`n` has to be Integer.)
--
-- >>> replicate 0 True
-- []
-- >>> replicate (-1) True
-- []
-- >>> replicate 4 True
-- [True,True,True,True]
replicate' :: Int -> a -> [a]
replicate' i x
  | i <= 0    = []
  | otherwise = take i $ repeat' x

-- Question 3
-- Write a function called `concat'` that concatenates a list of lists.
--
-- >>> concat' [[1,2],[3],[4,5,6]]
-- [1,2,3,4,5,6]
concat' :: [[Int]] -> [Int]
concat' [[]]    = []
concat' (xs:[]) = xs
concat' (xs:ys) = xs ++ concat' ys

-- Proposed solution
concat'' :: [[a]] -> [a]
concat'' = foldr (++) []

-- Question 4 Write a function called `zip'` that takes two lists and
-- returns a list of corresponding pairs (zips them) like this:
--
-- >>> zip' [1, 2] ['a', 'b']
-- [(1,'a'),(2,'b')]
--
-- If one input list is shorter than the other, excess elements of the
-- longer list are discarded, even if one of the lists is infinite:
--
-- >>> zip' [1] ['a', 'b']
-- [(1,'a')]
-- >>> zip' [1, 2] ['a']
-- [(1,'a')]
-- >>> zip' [] [1..]
-- []
-- >>> zip' [1..] []
-- []
zip' :: [a] -> [b] -> [(a, b)]
zip' [] _          = []
zip' _ []          = []
zip' (x:xs) (y:ys) = (x, y) : zip' xs ys

-- Question 5 Create a function called `zipWith'` that generalises
-- `zip'` by zipping with a function given as the first argument,
-- instead of a tupling function.
--
-- > zipWith' (,) xs ys == zip' xs ys
-- > zipWith' f [x1,x2,x3..] [y1,y2,y3..] == [f x1 y1, f x2 y2, f x3 y3..]
--
-- For example, `zipWith' (+)` is applied to two lists to produce the
-- list of corresponding sums:
--
-- >>> zipWith (+) [1, 2, 3] [4, 5, 6]
-- [5,7,9]
zipWith' :: (a -> b -> c) -> [a] -> [b] -> [c]
zipWith' _ [] _          = []
zipWith' _ _ []          = []
zipWith' f (x:xs) (y:ys) = (f x y) : zipWith' f xs ys

-- Question 6 Write a function called `takeWhile'` that takes a
-- precate and a list and returns the list up until an element that
-- doesn't satisfy the predicate.
--
-- >>> takeWhile (< 3) [1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4]
-- [1,2]
-- >>> takeWhile (< 9) [1,2,3]
-- [1,2,3]
-- >>> takeWhile (< 0) [1,2,3]
-- []
takeWhile' :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]
takeWhile' _ []     = []
takeWhile' p (x:xs) = if p x
                      then x:[]
                      else x : takeWhile' p xs

--Proposed solution
takeWhile'' :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]
takeWhile'' _ [] = []
takeWhile'' p (x : xs)
  | p x = x : takeWhile'' p xs
  | otherwise = []

-- Question 7 (More difficult) Write a function that takes in an
-- integer n, calculates the factorial n! and returns a string in the
-- form of 1*2* ... *n = n! where n! is the actual result.
verbFact :: Integer -> String
verbFact n = verbFact' n 1

verbFact' :: Integer -> Integer  -> String
verbFact' 1 c = "1 = " ++ show c
verbFact' n c = show n ++ "*" ++ verbFact' (n - 1) (c * n)

-- Proposed solution
factorial :: Int -> String
factorial n = accumulate 2 "1" ++ " = " ++ show result
  where
    accumulate x string
      | x > n = string
      | otherwise = accumulate (x + 1) (string ++ "*" ++ show x)
    result = product [1 .. n]

-- Question 8 Below you have defined some beer prices in
-- bevogBeerPrices and your order list in orderList + the
-- deliveryCost. Write a function that takes in an order and
-- calculates the cost including delivery. Assume that the two lists
-- have the beers in the same order.

bevogBeerPrices :: [(String, Double)]
bevogBeerPrices =
  [ ("Tak", 6.00),
    ("Kramah", 7.00),
    ("Ond", 8.50),
    ("Baja", 7.50)
  ]

orderList :: [(String, Double)]
orderList =
  [ ("Tak", 5),
    ("Kramah", 4),
    ("Ond", 7)
  ]

deliveryCost :: Double
deliveryCost = 8.50

costOrder :: [(String, Double)] -> Double
costOrder [] = 0
costOrder ((beer, n):xs) = (n * (snd $ head $ filter (\(b,p) -> b == beer) bevogBeerPrices))
                           + costOrder xs

-- Proposed solution
beerCosts :: [(String, Double)] -> Double
beerCosts =
  foldr (+) deliveryCost
    . zipWith (*) (map snd bevogBeerPrices)
    . map snd
    . filter (\name -> fst name `elem` map fst bevogBeerPrices)

-- Question from classmate
fruitWithA :: Char -> [(String, Int)]
fruitWithA y = filter tempFunct [("Apple",1), ("Banana",2), ("Pear",3), ("Grape",4), ("Wood",5)]
  where tempFunct x = elem y $ fst x
